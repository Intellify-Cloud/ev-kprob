Our passion lies in getting you the keys to your very own home! We genuinely do a happy dance for you when your home loan finance is approved by the banks! And boy, we sure do a lot of dancing!
    <br><br>
    Having been employed as a Credit Manager, in the past, we know exactly what information the banks require to approve your home loan, saving you frustration, time and money!    <br><br>
    To us at evo Key Pro Bonds you are not just a number, we genuinely care about each and every one of our clients!
    <br><br>
    Key Pro Bonds is fully dedicated to getting your home loan application approved - securing you the best possible deal from the banks, in the quickest time possible, with the least amount of effort on your part! Our ambition is to provide home ownership to as many South Africans as possible!    
    <br><br>
    Once you have provided Key Pro Bonds with all the required information and documentation, we take the reins and ensure that your application is prepared, motivated, and submitted to the banks in the correct format and in the quickest possible time.  We have close communication with the banks and receive live feedback on every step of the application which we relay to you, thereby reducing the stress of the wait…
    <br><br>
    Key Pro Bonds guides you from the application stage to bond registration – constantly keeping you informed on all progress!  The bond application and registration process can be a bit complicated, and we certainly have no problem in sharing our knowledge and experience of the steps in the process – we patiently explain and answer all your questions.
    <br><br>
    Having started our careers in legal collections at the bank we understand why the National Credit Act is so important – the banks are bound by this Act to lend within a certain criterion to protect you!  
    We are also able to advise and guide you on how to improve your Credit Ratings from a qualified and experienced perspective.
